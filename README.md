## 1. Structures  

`Coding_assignment.ipynb` is the final assignment.  

This code repository is from Precedence-Constrained Winter Value for Effective Graph Data Valuation:  
- `pc_winter_run.py`: Main script to run PC-Winter and calculate PC values for graph elements.
- `node_drop_large_cora.py`: Script to aggregate node values calculated by PC-Winter and evaluate performance by sequentially dropping high-value nodes.
